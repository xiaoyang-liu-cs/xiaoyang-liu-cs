# Hey, I'm Xiaoyang Liu.

I'm a software engineer and founding team member at a stealth-mode startup backed by Mozilla Builders Incubator in San Francisco and I will join a voice games startup backed by Y Combinator this summer as a software engineer intern. Iâ€™m a freshman majoring in Computer Science at UCLA Henry Samueli School of Engineering. I am interested in TypeScript, Deno, Rust, and WebAssembly.
