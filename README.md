I am a full stack developer and an open-source enthusiast. Before starting college, I am working as a Software Engineer Intern at WorthaRead, collaborating with a passionate team to build an anti-clickbait platform, providing high quality, thought-provoking content to users in an easy-to-explore manner.

I will attend the University of California, Los Angeles to pursue a Bachelor's Degree in Computer Science and explore my interests in Engineering, Entrepreneurship, and Philosophy.
